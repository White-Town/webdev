  <h2>This is the first chapter of web development</h2>
  <h3>we will learn the basics of networking and how internet works</h3>
  <h3>what is internet??</h3>
  <p>interconnected network of computers around the world.</p>
  <h2>client vs server</h2>
  <p>client is the computer devices or mobile or any electronic device that request for the data to the server</p>
  <p>server is the one who serve the data to the client and it is in online 24/7</p>
  <ul>
    <li>ip  adddress- internet protocol address. unique address assigned to each device that is connected to the internet. that is bascially the address of the each device connected to the internet.</li>
    <li>ISP: Internet Serivce Provider. these are the company that provide the ip address to the each device connected to the inernet and also provide the internet connection. like worldlink, jio, ntc</li>
    <li>DNS: Domain Name System. These are the system server that converts domain name to the ip address so that the device can connect to the internet</li>
  </ul>
  <p>this is what happens when I type facebook.com in my browser</p>
  <p>client type google.com in browser searh bar --> ISP --> DNS:convert domain name facebook.com to ip address --> request goes through that ip address to the faebook server --> then server sent the data back to your browser</p>
